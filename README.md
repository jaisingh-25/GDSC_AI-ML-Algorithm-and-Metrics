# GDSC_AI-ML-Algorithm-and-Metrics

Problem Statement - Build 2 machine learning models for tabular data. One model should be trained on data for classification, and the other for regression. You may use any ML algorithm. Report the final test set accuracy and test set mean squared error for the respective models.
  
This project contains 2 different models - 1 for Linear Regression (House Pricing) and 1 for Logistic Regression (Cancer Classification)
The ParisHousing.csv dataset has been used to train the Linear Regression model and the data.csv dataset has been used to train the Logistic Regression model.
